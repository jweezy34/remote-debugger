# Learning Task 4

## Learning Objectives 

* Unit test C code using Google Test

## Issues

* You guessed it: unit test your csdbgd.c code
* Install Google Test by following the instructions 
    [here](../resources/InstallGoogleTest.md)
* Create a directory in `csdbg-service` named `test` and create your unit test
    files there. Recognize that you will be building your unit tests with a
    C++ compiler (Google Test is written in C++) but linking against your C
    source code. Is there a way to do that cleanly? 
    Hint: look into the `extern` reserved word in header files.
* Wrestle with this for a little bit, but don't kill yourself. Find examples,
    follow them as best you can, but reach out to me when you've had enough.
